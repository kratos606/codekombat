- üóÑÔ∏è **Backend with Node.js & Express:** Robust backend API that handles challenge submissions, user authentication, and more.
- üóÇÔ∏è **Database:** Uses MongoDB for storing user data, challenges, and submission history.
- üê≥ **Docker Environment:** All code executions run inside Docker containers, ensuring a safe and isolated environment.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- Docker
- MongoDB (or a MongoDB Atlas account)
- Python
- Pillow

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kratos606/codekombat.git
    cd codekombat
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables: Create a `.env` file and add the following:
    ```env
    MONGO_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
    PORT=5000
    JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
    ```

4. Run the app:
    ```bash
    npm run server
    ```
    The app will be running on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### Client-Side Development
The client is already built. To update the client side during development:
1. Update the `app.config.js` file in the `client-vite` folder with the backend URL.
2. Run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    **Important:** In `index.js`, comment out the part that serves the built version of the frontend to ensure the development version is served.

### Docker
Code execution is managed through Docker containers, ensuring a secure and isolated environment for running code challenges.

## üéØ Usage
1. Sign up or log in to your account.
2. Choose a coding challenge based on your skill level.
3. Use the in-browser code editor to solve the challenge.
4. Submit your solution and see instant feedback.
